# Welcome to My AI Study Notes

This blog is my personal space to document what I’m learning as I explore the world of Artificial Intelligence. From foundational concepts like machine learning and neural networks to hands-on projects and research insights, I’ll be sharing notes, resources, and reflections along the way.

Whether you’re a fellow learner or just curious about AI, I hope you find something useful here.
